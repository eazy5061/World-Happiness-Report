The aim of this project is to analyze a public dataset taken from Kaggle to find out what are the parameters that influences happiness in the world. The World Happiness Report dataset provides annual insights into global happiness rankings based on factors like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption perceptions. This analysis aims to explore these factors to understand what influences happiness across different countries. I will be using R programming which I learnt from Google Data Analyst course to analyze this dataset for year 2019.
